##Description
Python Kivy code creates a UI that is used for the user to interact with a physical therapy device that applies pressure.


##Installation

The python and kivy code within this folder require python packages to be installed.

If using a Windows OS (assuming Windows 10), open CMD and enter in the following commands.

'''CMD
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew
python -m pip install kivy.deps.gstreamer
python -m pip install kivy.deps.angle
python -m pip install kivy

'''

Once these packages have been updated/installed, the python kivy code will be able to run. 
Make sure the latest version of python 3 is installed and added to your system path.
